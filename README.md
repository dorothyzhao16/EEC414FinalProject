## Welcome to eHealth: A Hospital Website Design Example

Smart healthcare implementation in hospitals will make a significant difference to patients, healthcare professionals, and the healthcare industry as a whole. Increasing the prevalence and usage of the Internet of Things in medical fields, such as diagnosis, surgery, prevention, and chronic pain management, has the potential to improve the health of many, decrease risks and costs of current day methods, and increase efficiency of communication. Websites, data cataloguing, medical tools, and several other aspects of a hospital setting and patient-physician interaction are both incredibly valuable.
